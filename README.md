Purpose: coming from a Pixel 6 running Graphene OS, I just can't stand Google, Samsung and my internet provider bloat. I don't like relying on premade / universal / GUI scripts that I don't have control with, therefore I made some very simple ADB commands to clean up my phone. In case you need to factory reset or if apps come back after an update, it's much faster to apply rather than manually uninstalling/disabling apps.
For system apps, I disable them instead of uninstalling them. Usually, this strategy sticks better
